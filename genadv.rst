Finding Your Primary Advisor
****************************
You can find your primary advisor by checking DegreeWorks. This information will be listed near the top of the page, and it will appear approximately as shown in the examples below.

If you arrive at Maritime as a first-time student and are enrolled in LEAD 101, your primary advisor is usually your LEAD 101 instructor for your first year. Your DegreeWorks page will look something like the below image. In the image below, for example, the student should seek out Mrs. Stroud for advisement.
