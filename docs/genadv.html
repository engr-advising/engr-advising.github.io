<p>All students <strong>must</strong> complete advisement each semester in order to receive their registration PIN. This is not optional. Advisement must be completed with your primary advisor, and you must fill out a Degree Curricula (sometimes called a curriculum sheet) for your major and catalog year before your advising appointment.</p>
<section id="finding-your-primary-advisor">
<h3>Finding Your Primary Advisor<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-your-primary-advisor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You can find your primary advisor by checking DegreeWorks. This information will be listed near the top of the page, and it will appear approximately as shown in the examples below.</p>
<p>If you arrive at Maritime as a first-year student and are enrolled in LEAD 101, your primary advisor is your LEAD 101 instructor for your first year. Your DegreeWorks page will have a section near the top that looks like the image below, which lists your primary advisor. In the image below, for example, the student should seek out Mrs. Stroud for advisement.</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/advisor1.png"><img alt="_images/advisor1.png" src="_images/advisor1.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</figure>
<p>Once you become a second-year student, or if you transfer to Maritime as an upper-division student, your primary advisor will be someone in your major. In the image below, for example, the student should seek out Dr. Gosselin for advisement.</p>
<figure class="align-center">

<h3>When and Where to Get Advisement<a class="headerlink" href="#when-and-where-to-get-advisement" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The advisement periods each semester are listed on the Maritime College calendar <a class="reference external" href="https://www.calendarwiz.com/calendars/calendar.php?crd=maritimedemo">Maritime College calendar</a> and found below for the current semester. Note that first-year student advisement starts a week before general advisement. Your primary advisor will probably reach out to you about how to schedule an appointment. They might have a sign-up page on their door, or they may hold open office hours, or they may use an electronic appointment platform. If you don’t hear from them before the start of advisement week, you should email them to request information on how to make an appointment.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Determine your catalog year. This is found on DegreeWorks, as shown in the example image below. It is <strong>crucial</strong> that you know your catalog year, as there were significant changes to the Degree Curricula in 2023-24.

<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Find and print the appropriate curriculum sheet for your catalog year, major, and license option (see Documents section below).</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the curriculum sheet by making notations to the <strong>right</strong> of the credit hours:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Mark courses you’ve already completed, either at Maritime or via transfer credit, with a check (✔)</p></li>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use DegreeWorks to help you complete items 3a and 3b.</p>
<p>To complete item 3c, you should take into account the following concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Which courses are only offered in fall or spring (bold-faced font on the curriculum sheet).</p></li>
<li><p>How many credits you wish to take.</p></li>

<section id="how-to-register-for-classes">
<h3>How to Register for Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-register-for-classes" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You should determine your registration date by checking the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.calendarwiz.com/calendars/calendar.php?crd=maritimedemo">Maritime College calendar</a>. Your class standing is determined based on the degree completion percentage shown in DegreeWorks, broken down as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Freshman: 0-24%</p></li>
<li><p>Sophomore: 25-49%</p></li>
<li><p>Junior: 50-74%</p></li>
<li><p>Senior: 75% and above</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Registration begins promptly at 6 AM. It is recommended that before registration begins, you determine which classes and sections you wish to take, and write down the CRN for each one. You should also have your registration PIN, provided by your advisor during registration, ready. The registrar’s page has a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sunymaritime.edu/sites/default/files/2022-01/Self%20Service%20Registration%20Instructions.pdf">tutorial</a> to assist you in using the CRNs to register to classes. This document also explains the errors that can occur during registration.</p>

<h3>Degree Curricula<a class="headerlink" href="#degree-curricula" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Degree Curricula for all Engineering majors are sorted by catalog year in <a class="reference external" href="https://sunymaritime0-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/kgosselin_sunymaritime_edu/Emjbhji_76ZPtDnYXJI7yUcBeAIHCi3RST6mE5Xusvnqqg?e=xts9iz">this folder</a>. They are sorted by catalog year, then by major and license, and you should select the file with the words “Degree Curricula” in the filaname.</p>
<p>To read your curriculum sheet, keep these things in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Any course which is written in <strong>bold face</strong> is only offered in the semester in which is it listed.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, the semesters in which each course is written is only a suggestion. You may take classes in different semesters than indicated, and you may sometimes take them out of order.</p></li>
<li><p>To determine what to take next, you should keep in mind pre- and co-requisites, which are listed on the curriculum flow charts, as described in the next section.</p></li>

<section id="flowcharts">
<h3>Flowcharts<a class="headerlink" href="#flowcharts" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>

<p>To read your curriculum flow chart, keep these things in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Solid lines indicate pre-requisites.</p></li>
<li><p>Dotted lines indicate co-requisites.</p></li>
<li><p>A few courses have a minimum grade to advance to a post-requisite, indicated by a red line and text which lists the required grade.</p></li>
<li><p>The semesters on the flow chart match the curriculum sheet and are similarly considered suggestions in most cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind pre-requisite chains when choosing classes to take. A good rule of thumb is to find the senior design sequence for your major and work backward through the pre-requisites.</p></li>
