General Education Requirements
==============================

Overview
--------

Students who entered Maritime College in Spring 2023 and earlier follow the old Maritime College general education requirements. For the majority of Engineering students, this consists of 4 required classes listed on your Degree Curricula: HIST 101, HIST 101, HUMN 201, and HUMN 202. See your advisor with any questions about these requirements.

Students entering Maritime College in Fall 2023 and later must follow the new SUNY General Education Framework, which are more flexible and allow you to choose some courses. They are detailed below. Note that the courses available in each subject area may change in time; this page was last updated on October 25, 2023.

Gen Ed Framework
-----------------
The full SUNY Gen Ed framework is found on `this page <https://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/acaproplan/general-education/suny-ge/>`_ However, this is far more information than you need, and it doesn't tell you how to apply it to Maritime-specific courses, nor your degree program.

As a Maritime College engineering student, you can think of the General Education framework as 7 courses in 3 categories:

1. 3 courses built into your major.

2. 1 DEISJ course.

3. 3 courses you get to choose.

3 courses built into your major
*******************************

All Engineering students are required to take the following courses, which automatically fulfill specific areas within the Gen Ed Framework.

+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Courses                                      | Gen Ed Area                                    |
+==============================================+================================================+
| MATH 101: Calculus I                         | GERM: Mathematics (and Quantitative Reasoning) |
|                                              |                                                |
| MATH 102: Calculus II                        |                                                |
+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| CHEM 121/122: General Chemistry and Lab      | GERN: Natural Science                          |
|                                              |                                                |
| PHYS 102/104: Engineering Physics I and Lab  |                                                |
|                                              |                                                |
| PHYS 201/203: Engineering Physics II and Lab |                                                |
+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ENGL 101: Freshman English I                 | GERC: Basic Communication (Written & Oral)     |
+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

You can essentially ignore these three required areas, as your degree program will automatically fulfill them.

1 DEISJ Course
**************
You must take one of the following Maritime courses to fulfill the area of Diversity: Equity, Inclusion, and Social Justice:

	* HUMN 217: Oceanic Migrations
	* ENGL 213: LatinX Literature
	* HUMN 216: Introduction to Jazz History


3 courses you get to choose
***************************

In addition to the above, you are required to take 3 additional general education classes. These are listed as "General Education Electives" on your Degree Curricula. The classes you take must come from 3 of the following 5 areas:
	* GERS: Social Science
	* GERU: Humanities
	* GERA: Arts
	* GERH: US History & Civic Engagement
	* GERG: World History & Global Awareness

The current courses available in each area are listed below. Notice that you must take courses from 3 **unique** areas. For example, if you take two classes in the Social Sciences area, only one will count toward your general education requirements.

Social Science courses:
	* GBEC 121: Essentials of Macroeconomics
	* GBEC 122: Essentials of Microeconomics

Humanities courses:
	* HUMN 230: Introduction to Philosophy

Arts courses:
	* ENGL 250: Drama
	* HUMN 251: Introduction to World Music

US History & Civic Engagement courses:
	* HIST 101: US History to 1865
	* HIST 102: US History Since 1865

World History & Global Awareness courses:
	* HUMN 201: Early World Civilization & Culture
	* HUMN 202: Later World Civilization & Culture

Resources
---------

As you navigate this new framework, you are encouraged to make use of all available resources, listed below in the order in which you should try them.

Gen Ed Worksheet
****************

Maritime College has provided a Gen Ed Worksheet to help you keep track of the requirements. It may be downloaded :download:`here <files/GenEdWorksheet_Fall2023.pdf>`

Note that this is a worksheet applicable to all students at Maritime College, so it lists all courses which fulfill the Mathematics and Natural Science areas.

DegreeWorks
***********

DegreeWorks is programmed with the new Gen Ed requirements.

Somewhere near the top of the page, you will see the DEISJ requirement, with the available classes listed to the right:

Near the bottom of the page, you will see the Gen Ed Elective requirement, with the available courses listed in each area:
.. figure::  _images/gened2.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

As you take courses that fulfill these requirements, DegreeWorks will show them as being completed. The Gen Ed Elective list is very helpful to consult if you forget which area(s) you've already taken classes in, so that you don't accidentally repeat it.

Your Advisor
************

If you are confused about how to use the Gen Ed Worksheet or what is shown in DegreeWorks, you should reach out to your advisor for guidance.

Transfer Students
-----------------

Students who have already taken some or all of their required Gen Ed courses at another school may deviate slightly from the above framework. For example, there is an additional allowed category called World Languages, but I have not listed it in the requirements above, as Maritime College currently doesn't have any courses in that area. That said, the overall framework is identical across all SUNY campuses, so your Gen Ed courses should transfer relatively cleanly. See your advisor with any questions about your particular situation.
